    <description>
      <p>Devine blood aasimar are stronger celestial souls that have knots to break and evil to erase with your inner light. But power often comes with a cost. Using your <em>Devine Soul</em> may lead into a small amnesia making you forget about the fact you transformed and what happend during that time and shortly before that. So, as a character you have to untie your inner knot to embrace yourself completely.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br />
        <span class="feature">Devine Soul.</span>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to glimmer and six luminous, incorporeal wings to sprout from your back. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.<br />
        <span class="feature">Devine Flashback.</span>You cannot remember your transformations. Even if someone tries to explain to you what happend. You may have to meet another celestial to tell you. After this knot has been removed you are aware of your divine soul and of all memories.<br />
        <span class="feature">Devine Truth.</span>Starting at level 12, the world tells you all any secret and you reveal every deception. You can sense all creatures within 10 feet of you and know if any of those creatures tell you a lie.<br />
