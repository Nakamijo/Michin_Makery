      <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
      <p>Lunatic Followers are suckers for the night, stars and of cause the moon. They mostly sleep during the day and live through the night. Their favourite gem is the moonstone and their most loved material silver. You can imagine what reaction a dagger made out of silver with moonstones and star carvings on it could create?</p>

      <p>You feel the most comfortable under the night sky. During the night, as long as you can see stars you have advantage on any orientation related checks. You may even meditate to communicate with the stars and moon to ask them where to go and what to do. Sometime their answers are not that easy to understand.</p>
