The target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier and has advantage on it's next attack. This spell has no effect on constructs.

      <p>You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of radiant energy streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9d6 radiant damage and cannot become invisible. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and can turn invisible.</p>

      <p>You point on a target within range and unleash a lunatic beam to strike it with immense force. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.  On hit, the target takes 8d8 radiant or force damage (your choice) and must make a charisma saving throw. On a failed save the next attack against the target has advantage. Alternatively, the next saving throw of the target has disadvantage, whichever situation is first.</p>

      <p>A shining figure glowing with moonlight appears at your shoulder, and reaches out to a creature within range. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, the grasp cleaves into their soul, inflicting 10d6 radiant damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 30 hit points or fewer, they are instantly slain. If they succeed they receive half damage and do not get executed. Once the attack is made, the figure vanishes. If the target has a natural 20 on its saving throw, it receives no damage. On a natural 1 instead, the damage is doubled.</p>

        You summon a massive amount of moonlight that surrounds you, sparkling the air around your body and infusing you with glowing strength.

It takes 5d6 radiant damage on a failed save. While <em>Lunar Vengeance</em> is active you have advantage on attack rolls and spell attack rolls that deal radiant damage.
