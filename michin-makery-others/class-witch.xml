    <description>
      <p>
        A tattooed elf, veiled and cloaked, draws his obsidian dagger across the sand, calling forth from the lines a ghostly apparition to help him and his allies find their way. A trio of halfling hermits gather among candles and incense, chanting words of power to bait spirits from the shadows. The bejeweled human, dressed in exotic garb and golden chains bellows a spell which echoes with the voices of an army of lost souls, a fiendish glint in his eyes as blood drips from his palm.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">Unlike shamans who pray to the spirits of nature, witches trap the tormented souls of those lost betwixt the realm of the living and the beyond. As a witch, you learn to summon these souls and bind them to your will, gaining protection from them and power over them. As you attain higher levels, the covenant you choose to live by grants you further abilities which extend the utility and power of these bonds in different ways.</p>
      <h4>The Power of Spirit</h4>
      <p>Witches may or may not have a level of respect for the spirits they bind, though one could say they should. Some witches tap into the residual energies of long-departed souls, while others use extant spiritual beings as conduits for their spellcasting. Either way and whether or not they wish, witches bind part of their own soul to those that surround them.</p>
      <p class="indent">Witch spells mostly deal with manipulation of spiritual energies (both living and dead) and protections against the beings who supply those energies. As part of their connection to the spiritual world, they are also privy to information and secrets normally not meant for mortal minds. As such, witches are powerful enchanters, abjurers, and diviners.</p>
      <h4>Bonds of the Soul</h4>
      <p>Witches acknowledge that there is a spiritual connection between all things – forces that inexplicably and randomly bind beings and happenings together in a kind of mass, shared fate. They see other witches as brothers and sisters, and other classes as close cousins. As a consequence, witches are often fond of forming alliances. The covenant that a witch subscribes to is one such alliance.</p>
      <p class="indent">Covenants are the manifestation of a philosophy regarding the nature of spirits. Some, like the Covenant of Unity, believe in a supreme energy that extends beyond the physical world, weaving together magic and the collective conscience of all living things. Others, from the Covenant of Blood for example, believe in a more intimate connection between the physical world and the other side. In this philosophy, each soul is tied to something close to it in the physical world – a body, an object, or location that was important to it when it was alive.</p>
      <h4>Creating A Witch</h4>
      <p>When deciding to play a witch, think about what led your character to tap into the spirit world. Maybe witchcraft is a tradition in the area, or your character comes from an area rife with a ghostly past. Superstition is also a good trigger for a fascination with spirits. What is your relationship with spirits? Is there a measure of mutual respect? </p>
      <p class="indent">Perhaps your character feels more like a servant to the spirit than the other way around, or maybe they possess the entitlement to dominate and extort spiritual beings.</p>
      <p class="indent">How did your character come to be an adventurer? It could be that he or she was a pariah in their community due to contact with the other side, cast out and forced to fend for him or herself. Perhaps your character is even haunted by a particular spirit, and seeks away to control or be rid of it.</p>

      <p>Your contact with the spirit world and intuitive knowledge of the magic which allows it to persist grants you the use of spells.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Cantrips</h5>
      <p>You know three cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spell Slots</h5>
      <p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and above. To cast one of these witch spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p class="intend">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and you have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
      <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. </p>
      <p class="intend">The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
      <p class="intend">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose on of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
      <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells, since your magic comes from bargaining with spirits. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <center>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
        </p>
      </center>
      <h5 class="caption">Ritual Casting</h5>
      <p>You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

    <description>
      <p>At 2nd level you can bind spirits to your service. Binding a spirit requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted meditation. During this time, the witch speaks the invocations required to summon the spirit forth and enacts the rite of binding depending on which philosophy the witch subscribes to. A blood witch might utilize a bone fragment to bind the spirit, while a shadow witch might bargain with the summoned spirit, exchanging a secret for the spirit’s service. A witch may perform this ritual at any time to swap a bound spirit for a new one, losing the old passive benefit and gaining the new (or simply to change the spell slot level the same spirit is occupying).</p>
      <p class="intend">You choose a spirit to bind from the list at the end of this class description, and you fill one of your available spell slots with the spirit. The spell slot used is no longer available for casting spells, and it remains unavailable for as long as the spirit filling it remains bound to you. The spirit is said to be of a level equal to the spell slot used to bind it. Thus, a Spirit of Passion occupying a 6th level spell slot is a level 6 spirit. You cannot have more than one spirit with the same name bound at once. </p>
      <p class="intend">Depending on the type of spirit, you gain certain benefits while the spirit remains bound and an additional effect when you release the spirit, as detailed in the Binding Rites section. Releasing a spirit is a bonus action, although some spirits allow release as a reaction. Once a spirit has been released, it no longer provides its passive effect and the spell slot it occupied is expended. </p>
      <p class="intend">You can bind a number of spirits up to the number shown for your witch level in the Bonds column of the witch table.</p>

      <p>Witches of the Covenant of Blood believe in strong connections between the physical world and the spiritual one.

This knowledge allows a witch to bind spirits more easily — as long as they know something of the spirit's life.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Witches of the Covenant of Charm tap deep into the emotions which govern lingering spirits’ behaviours. They use these emotions as signposts and guides to manipulate the desires and shape the aspirations of the living. They believe that although lingering spirits are echoes of the past, they hold the key to individual futures. By harnessing the raw emotional energy of the beyond, one can gain absolute control over the hearts and minds of those around them.</p>
      <p class="intend">Witches of this philosophy vary in their treatment of spirits. Some befriend and learn from the spirits they bind, using that knowledge to further their own ends. Others take only cursory notice of the spirits they enslave – an attitude that often carries over into their living interactions, manipulating and charming those they will, without any true regard for the desires of those they meet.</p>

You can therefore cast spells with these components even if you yourself cannot motion or vocalize. Additionally, when you are hidden from a creature and cast a spell, casting the spell doesn't reveal your position to it.
