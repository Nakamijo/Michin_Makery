    <description>
      <p>The fighter stands tall with their sword and shield in hand, running toward the battle. The wizard staying back to cast spells from afar. The rogue sneaking their way around to find the best angle at which to strike. Right in the middle of the battle, here comes not the cleric but the healer. The healer rushes in, casting aside their own safety for the vitality of others. Running to ensure the fighter can keep fighting the good fight, ensuring the wizard can continue to blow holes in the enemies defenses, all the while the rogue launching their sneak attacks against unsuspecting enemies. The healer rushes to them all, riding in on their celestial companion, showing all that they are devoted to the cause of life.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A HEALER</h4>
      <p>The healer provides aid to members of their adventuring company, the soldiers of their religion, or to the alliance to which they are pledged. When a battlefield is strewn with wounded allies or an expedition team’s members are sorely hurt, a healer cures the injuries of the faithful and those who have allied themselves with the side of good. A healer might accept a commission to escort a company or war band on a dangerous mission, making themselves available to cast divine protection and offer divine healing. The healer is much revered for their services, and they may ask their companions for daily praise to their deity---or at least an equal share in any reward garnered after the successful conclusion of the adventure or military action.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a Healer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score followed by Charisma and then closely followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the Hermit background from the Player's Handbook.</p>

      <p>As a devoted user of healing and the divine, you have access to cleric spells. However, the only spells a Healer may take that deal damage are Guiding Bolt or Toll the Dead. Healers do not acquire spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, by praying to their deity they are granted the ability to innately pull forth divine magic, meaning a Healer would cast a spell as a sorcerer would using a Holy Symbol rather than an Arcane Focus to cast their spells.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Healer table.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">LEARNING SPELL</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know a number of spells equal to your proficiency bonus. You learn a number of spells equal to your proficiency bonus each time you level up.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your healer spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a healer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a healer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <center>
        <p>
          <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

    <description>
      <p>When a healer attains 8th level, the deities recognize them for their devotion and grant them a celestial unicorn companion as their mount and aid. The unicorn is a symbol of healing and purity which serves the healer willingly and unswervingly.</p>
      <p class="indent">Once per long rest, as an action, the healer may magically call their companion from the celestial realms in which it resides. The unicorn immediately appears adjacent to the healer and remains for 2 hours per healer level. It may be dismissed without expending an action. The unicorn is the same unicorn called for every time this feature is used. Each time the unicorn is called, it appears at full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The unicorn also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. At 20th level, the Unicorn stays with the Healer until it dies or is dismissed.</p>
      <p class="indent">A Healer’s Unicorn is superior to its normal celestial counterpart gaining new abilities as the partnership between the Healer and Unicorn grow. At 8th level, they are Empathically Linked up to a distance of 1 mile. The Empathic Link does not allow the Healer to see through the Unicorn’s eyes but they can communicate empathically. Due to the empathic link, the healer has the same connection to an item or place that the Unicorn does. In addition, the Unicorn takes half damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw and no damage on a successful one. The Healer does not gain this benefit unless they are riding the Unicorn when needing to make the save.</p>
      <p class="indent">At 10th level, the Healer and Unicorn can share saving throws. The Unicorn uses its own base save bonus or the healer’s, whichever is higher. The Unicorn applies its own ability modifiers to saves and it does not share any other bonuses on saves that the healer might have (such as from magic items or feats unless the item or feat allows it).</p>
      <p class="indent">At 11th level, spells cast from the Spellcasting feature of this class with a range of self or only targeting the Healer also effect the Unicorn when within 5ft of each other.</p>
      <p class="indent">At 12th level, the Unicorn gains 12 hit points plus double their constitution modifier. In addition, the unicorn also has a +2 to its AC. These bonuses improve as the strength of the Healer's bond between the Unicorn grows. At 17th level, the Unicorn gains an additional 12 hit points plus double their constitution modifier and an additional +2 AC. At 19th level, the Unicorn gains an additional 12 hit points plus double their constitution modifier and an additional +2 AC.</p>
      <p class="indent">At 14th level, the Unicorn’s Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence increase by 2.</p>
      <p class="indent">At 15th level, the Unicorn becomes proficient in Wisdom saving throws and adds half your proficiency bonus to Wisdom saving throws.</p>
      <p class="indent">At 18th level, the Unicorn has an increased move speed of 10ft.</p>
